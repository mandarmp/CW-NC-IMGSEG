# NC-CW


as on 19 november
still have to figure out how to give in batches.

not able to do binary cross entropy (bce) ...as the predicted output is (1,4,96,96) and the given mask is (1,96,96)

need to have a good theoretical knowledge of what dice loss, cross entropy and binary cross entropy losses are.
